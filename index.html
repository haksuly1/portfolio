              <h3><span class="heading-style">Overview</span></h3> 
              <br> 
                myFlix is a web app developed using the MERN stack, that provides users with access to information about movies, 
                directors and genres.<br>
                It is a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, that interacts with a non-relational database (MongoDB). 
                The API can be accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET or POST. 
                To retrieve data from and store data in the database, CRUD methods are used. 
                The API provides movie information in JSON format.
                Users are able to create an account, update their personal profile(data) and also create a list of fasvorite movies.
              <br><br>
              <h3><span class="heading-style">Purpose & Context</span></h3>
              <br>
                myFlix is my personal project built as part of my web development course at CareerFoundry educational institution 
                to demonstrate my mastery of full-stack web development.
                <br>
                  To test the API, Postman was used. I also included user authentication and authorization code in the form 
                  of basic HTTP authentication and JWT authentication.
                <br>
                  It is a responsive application, developed with AngularJS. It provides several interface views, 
                  including, but not limited to, a main view (shows a list of all movies), single movie view 
                  (shows data about a single movie and allows users to add the movie to their list of favourites), 
                  a login view, a registration view and a profile view (where users can update their user data and list of favourites).

              <h3><span class="heading-style">Objective</span></h3>

                The aim of the project was to have a grounded full-stack project that I will be able to add to my professional 
                portfiolio. The problem that I am to solve is build the complete server-side and client-side for the application 
                from scratch<br>
                - In this case using the Angular framework.

                <br>
                    The project is a React Native Project. This project is a chatapp for mobile devices using React Native.
                    The app provides users with a chat interface and options to share images and location.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h3><span class="heading-style">Development</span></h3>
                <br>
                    I used Expo to develop this app. It is optimized for both Android and iOS devices. The interface 
                    and functionallity was created using the Gifted Chat library.
                <br>
                 To store the chat messages, I used the Google Firestore Database. Images are stored in Firebase Cloud Storage. 
                 To make the chat conversations available offline , I used asyncStorage to store them locally. 
                 When users are offline, they can’t create new messages (using Gifted Chat’s renderInputToolbar prop). 
                 I also used Google Firebase authentication to authenticate users anonymously.
                <br><br>
                <h3><scan class="heading-style">Challenges</scan></h3>
                <br>
                <p>The greatest difficulty was geting the right version of firbase to complement the other development dependencies. 
                  Firebase 7.9.0 had to be forced in package.json after reinstallation of node_modules.
                <br><br>
                <h3><span class="heading-style">Conclusion</span></h3>
                <br>
                <p>This chatapp was the final project for my full-stack web development at CareerFoundry, Berlin, Germany. 
                   This project affords me the opportunity to understand the interraction between external database 
                   and a built application.

                This is a serverless, progressive web app (PWA) built with React using a test-driven development technique (TDD). 
                The app uses the Meet API to fetch upcoming events for a selected city, and OAuth2 authentication flow. 
                For the authorization server, it uses AWS Lambda. Alerts for users are created by using an OOP approach. 
                A service worker allows the app to work offline. The recharts library is used to visualize data with 
                a scatter graph and a pie chart.
              <br>
                It was built using React framework and Javascript language. This is a serverless app that Filter events list by city 
                with the following options:
              <br>- It is able to filter events by city.
              <br>- It is able to show/hide an event details.
              <br>- It is able to specify the number of events from home page.
              <br>- The App is available offline.
              <br>- There is shortcut to the App on the user’s home screen.

                 Users can search through a collection
                 of Pokémon that is loading from an external source(API). Images
                 and information about the specific Pokémon can be displayed in a
                 modal by clicking on a Pokémons name.
